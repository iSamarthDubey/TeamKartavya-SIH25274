I’ll treat this as: **“Design the full frontend (all screens) for Krishi Hedge based on the PS + your PDF.”**

I’ll list **every page**, grouped by **user role + platform**, and mention the **features / UI sections** each needs.

(Everything is taken from your SIH PPT: accessibility, AI forecast, forward contracts, simulated trading, alerts, FPO marketplace, education, blockchain verification, etc. )

## 0️⃣ User Roles & Platforms

**Roles**

1. **Farmer / Trader**

**Platforms**
